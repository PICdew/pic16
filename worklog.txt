2009-11-28: VICTORY! Serial communication is working. Wired up the MAX232 and
            used another usb-serial dongle that I had lying around. Noticed
            that I had bought 0.1uF capacitors instead of the 1.0uF capacitors
            the MAX232 requires, but it still worked. I'll replace the MAX232
            with a MAX232A.

2009-11-25: Spend an evening trying to read the serial data through the TTL-232R
            usb-to-serial thingy but couldn't get it to work. I think my
            oscillioscope is broken.

            Tried different power sources to make sure I understand how
            everything work. Realized that my PIC part is a low-voltage part,
            but I have a 5V serial cable.

2009-11-24: First serial character written to pin, seen on oscilloscope.
            Realized that the PIC was running on 8MHz.

2009-11-23: Portet test-2 to work on the new chip
